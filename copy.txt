Hi Everyone, I'm Katie. I'm a librarian at the Galvin Library and a longtime
Chicago resident. If you have any questions about the library let me know! I
just started the Information Architecture program and am looking forward to this
class!

Outside of work and class I like to ride my bike or walk around town. I got rid
of my car last year and it's been awesome. I also like finding things in alleys,
eating/making good food, thinking about early retirement, and reading.

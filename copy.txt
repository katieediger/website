My name is Katie Ediger and I am a User Experience Librarian. I work at the
Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) where I try to make the library easy and
intuitive for everyone to use.

I have a degree in Anthropology from Beloit College and a Masters in Library
and Information Science from Dominican University. I'm currently working on a
second masters degree in Information Architecture from IIT.

When I'm not at work or in class, you will probably find me roaming around
Chicago looking for good food or exciting ally finds.

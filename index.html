  <p>
    Hi Everyone, I'm Katie. I'm a librarian at the Galvin Library and a longtime
    Chicago resident. If you have any questions about the library let me know! I
    just started the Information Architecture program and am looking forward to
    this class!
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work and class I like to ride my bike or walk around town. I got
    rid of my car last year and it's been awesome. I also like finding things in
    alleys, eating/making good food, thinking about early retirement, and reading.

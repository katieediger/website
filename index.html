  <h1>Katie Ediger</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Katie Ediger and I am a User Experience Librarian. I work at the
    Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) where I try to make the library easy
    and intuitive for everyone to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a degree in Anthropology from Beloit College and a Masters in Library
    and Information Science from Dominican University. I'm currently working on
    a second masters degree in Information Architecture from IIT.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not at work or in class, you will probably find me roaming around
    Chicago looking for good food or exciting ally finds.
